## Model-View-Controller

MVC is all about separation of concerns, making sure different parts of your code do different things and you clearly know which part if responsible for what. MVC stands for model-view-controller.

- **Models**: represent data and logic in application code, e.g save and fetch
- **Views**: represent what the users sees, decoupled from application code
- **Controllers**: connect models and views , e.g. routes split across middleware
